                <td width = 72% bgcolor=#C0C0C0 valign="top"><h1 align="center">Giganotosaurus</h1><br/>The Giganotosaurus (jai-GA-nuh-tuh-saw-ruhs), meaning "Giant Southern lizard", is one of the Dinosaurs in ARK: Survival Evolved and is the most powerful therapod in the game.
                    <h2>Behavior:</h2><br/>Giganotosaurs will 'casually' stroll about the Island, slaughtering anything in it’s path. This can lead them to wander just about anywhere on the Island. Their lack of natural predators - or any form of threat to them - allows for their safe voyages across the Island. With no natural predator, 
                    the Giganotosaurus is considered the apex predator of the Island with its strength and size. One could argue that it is the driver of evolution on the maps they can be found on. Those that are strong enough to take one down or tame one are guaranteed to thrive nearly unchallenged. Those that can’t manage it end up with
                    significant resources lost at best, and ripped to shreds while possibly even losing everything at worst.<br/><h2>Habitat:</h2><img src="Screenshot 2022-05-17 172010.png" title="ARK-Fandom2"><br/><h2>General Combat:</h2>The Giganotosaurus is one of the few creatures capable of taking down a Guardian such as the Broodmother
                    by itself and as such much caution is needed when facing one. A wild or tamed Giganotosaurus is extremely dangerous simply because of its massive damage and health. This makes it one of the most deadly creatures on the island (if not the most deadly); even a low level wild Giganotosaurus can (and will) be a very serious 
                    threat. Whatever creature you fight it with, be aware of its  Gnashed ability. Avoid it if you don't want to get devoured in one or two bites. Having a tamed Giganotosaurus can be a representation of skill and progression. It is therefore not a good idea to head-on attack tamed Giga even if you can certainly take it on,
                    which might result in retaliation from the tamer. If you are willing to invest time in taking great care of a tamed giga from a baby to an adult that is imprinted by you, then you would have one of the strongest tames in the game.</td>
